## How to Run the Application

To run the entire application (backend, frontend, and database setup) with a single command, use the provided script:

```bash
./start.sh

Before running the script, make sure to configure the environment variables at the top of the start.sh file:

# Database configuration
DB_NAME="notesdb"
DB_USER="root"
DB_PASS="123456"
DB_HOST="localhost"
DB_PORT="3306"

BACKEND_DIR="./backend"
FRONTEND_DIR="./frontend"

# Path to MySQL executable (adjust this to your OS and MySQL installation)
MYSQL_CMD="/c/Program Files/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/bin/mysql.exe"

Make sure the MYSQL_CMD path matches your system's MySQL installation.
On macOS/Linux it might look like /usr/bin/mysql.
The script will:

    Verify or create the database

    Export environment variables used by the backend

    Start the Spring Boot backend

    Install frontend dependencies and serve the Angular app
